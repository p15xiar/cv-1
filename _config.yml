  Hey there, Iâ€™m Spyros and I am a senior student in the Department of Informatics of the Ionian University. 
  During my studies I gained a wide experience in the following fields:
  - Constructive wireless networks 
  - Hardware maintenance and repairing
  - E-shop creation 
  - Website creation 
  
  On top of the technical skills that were built throughout my experience in several companies, I consider myself as a great team player and strong analytical thinker.
