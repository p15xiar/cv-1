          The Ionian University was founded in 1984, the same year as the University of Thessaly and the University of the Aegean. The university comprises five faculties and twelve departments. Its seat is in Corfu, with university units in Lefkada, Kefalonia and Zakynthos.

          During my stay at Corfu I wanted to practice everything i got learned in class. That's why from the start of my second year in the university I started searching for work.
